## Firebase Authentication

The project uses Firebase Authentication for user management. The implementation includes:

### Setup and Configuration

- Firebase is configured in `src/utils/firebase.js`
- Uses Email/Password authentication method
- Includes error handling for authentication failures

### Features

- **User Sign Up**: New users can create accounts using email and password
- **User Sign In**: Existing users can log in with their credentials
- **Form Validation**: Includes validation for:
  - Full Name (Sign Up only)
  - Email format
  - Password requirements

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up Process**:
   ```javascript
   createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
````

- Creates new user account
- Handles registration errors
- Validates user input

2. **Sign In Process**:
   ```javascript
   signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
   ```
   - Authenticates existing users
   - Redirects to `/browse` on success
   - Displays appropriate error messages

### Error Handling

The application handles various authentication errors including:

- Invalid email format
- Weak passwords
- Already existing accounts
- Invalid credentials

### Environment Setup

To use Firebase in your own deployment:

1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console
2. Replace the `firebaseConfig` object in `src/utils/firebase.js` with your own configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
};
```

## Components

### Body.jsx

- Sets up routing using React Router.
- Defines two routes:
  - `/` - Renders the `Login` component.
  - `/browse` - Renders the `Browse` component.

### Browse.jsx

- A functional component that displays a heading with the text "Browse".

### Header.jsx

- A functional component that displays a header section with a logo image and a gradient background.

### Login.jsx

- A functional component that manages the state for toggling between sign-in and sign-up forms.
- Renders a form with input fields for email and password, and conditionally includes a full name input field for sign-up.
- Includes a button to submit the form and a link to toggle between sign-in and sign-up.
